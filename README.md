# CSTL-Tickets-Data-Webscraper
## 
Project Description
##
- In this project, I utilized Se
- lenium packages to scrape data from Web Help Desk website to collect monthly ticket data replacing the manual method and automate the monthly task at my working place (CTL). 
- The application provides a UI using Tkinter packages to give inputs to the scraper and to view and insert the collected data to the SQL Server database.
- The limitation of the app that needs to be improved: is quite slow from the scrapping work and sometimes the application crashes due to the fact that the Scraper could not find the UI element to select. It also requires constant updates because sometimes the CSS Selector get changed.
